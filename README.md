# DIRBS-Core
The Device Identification, Registration, Blocking, System (DIRBS) consists of a Core component, classification engine, and list generation capability along with a collection of subsystem components providing functions that include reporting, registration of IMEIs, verification of IMEI status, pairing of IMEIs with IMSIs to avoid blocking, and reporting of lost & stolen IMEIs.  Repositories are provided for each of these components; please see each respective repository for further details on installation and usage.  To support Identity & Access Management (IAM) and API gateway functionality, open-source options such as Keycloak (www.keycloak.org) and Tyk (https://tyk.io) are available and may be integrated for a DIRBS deployment.
